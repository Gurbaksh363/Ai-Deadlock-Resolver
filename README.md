# AI Deadlock Resolver

## Overview
AI Deadlock Resolver is a simple tool designed to help detect and resolve deadlocks in computing systems. It provides basic visualization of resource allocation and offers AI-based suggestions for resolving deadlocks. The project is developed as a learning tool for understanding deadlocks in operating systems.

## Features
- **Deadlock Detection**: Identifies potential deadlocks by analyzing process and resource allocation data.
- **Visualization**: Generates wait-for graphs to illustrate dependencies between processes and resources.
- **AI Suggestions**: Uses a basic AI model to recommend possible solutions.
- **Simple User Interface**: Built with Next.js and React for ease of use.
- **Educational Tool**: Helps students understand deadlock scenarios interactively.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend**: Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS
- **UI Components**: Lucide React
- **AI Integration**: Gemini AI for deadlock detection
- **Development Tools**: GitHub, npm/yarn, VS Code

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-deadlock-resolver.git

# Navigate to project directory
cd ai-deadlock-resolver

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

## Usage
1. Open `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
2. Enter process and resource allocation details.
3. Click "Analyze" to check for deadlocks.
4. View the generated wait-for graph and AI-based resolution suggestions.
